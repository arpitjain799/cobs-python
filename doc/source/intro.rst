Python functions for encoding and decoding COBS.

-----
Intro
-----

The :mod:`cobs` package is provided, which contains modules containing functions
for encoding and decoding according to COBS methods.


What Is COBS?
`````````````

COBS is a method of encoding a packet of bytes into a form that contains no
bytes with value zero (0x00). The input packet of bytes can contain bytes
in the full range of 0x00 to 0xFF. The COBS encoded packet is guaranteed to
generate packets with bytes only in the range 0x01 to 0xFF. Thus, in a
communication protocol, packet boundaries can be reliably delimited with 0x00
bytes.

The COBS encoding does have to increase the packet size to achieve this
encoding. However, compared to other byte-stuffing methods, the packet size
increase is reasonable and predictable. COBS always adds 1 byte to the
message length. Additionally, for longer packets of length *n*, it *may* add
:math:`\left\lfloor\frac{n}{254}\right\rfloor`
additional bytes to the encoded packet size.

For example, compare to the PPP protocol, which uses 0x7E bytes to delimit
PPP packets. The PPP protocol uses an "escape" style of byte stuffing,
replacing all occurences of 0x7E bytes in the packet with 0x7D 0x5E. But that
byte-stuffing method can potentially double the size of the packet in the
worst case. COBS uses a different method for byte-stuffing, which has a much
more reasonable worst-case overhead.

For more details about COBS, see the references [COBS]_ [COBSPPP]_.

I have included a variant on COBS, :ref:`COBS/R <COBS/R>`, which slightly
modifies COBS to often avoid the +1 byte overhead of COBS. So in many cases,
especially for smaller packets, the size of a COBS/R encoded packet is the
same size as the original packet. For more details about COBS/R see the
:ref:`documentation for Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing—Reduced <COBS/R>`.

"Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing—Reduced" (COBS/R) is my own invention, a
modification of basic COBS encoding, and is described in more detail in the
:ref:`documentation for Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing—Reduced <COBS/R>`.

The following are not implemented:

COBS/ZRE            Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing—Zero Run Elimination [COBSPPP]_
==================  ======================================================================

A pure Python implementation and a C extension implementation are provided. If
the C extension is not available for some reason, the pure Python version will
be used.


-----
Usage
-----

The modules provide an :func:`encode` and a :func:`decode` function.

For usage, see the examples provided in the modules:

    * :ref:`COBS Examples <cobs-examples>` in :mod:`cobs.cobs`
    * :ref:`COBS/R Examples <cobsr-examples>` in :mod:`cobs.cobsr`


-------------------------
Supported Python Versions
-------------------------

Python >= 2.4 and 3.x are supported, and have both a C extension and a pure
Python implementation.

Python versions < 2.4 might work, but have not been tested. Python 3.0 has
also not been tested.


--------
Download
--------

Source code and binaries can be downloaded from the `Python package index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cobs>`_.

The Git source code repository for development is on `GitHub <https://github.com/cmcqueen/cobs-python>`_.


------------
Installation
------------

The cobs package is installed using :mod:`distutils`.  If you have the tools
installed to build a Python extension module, run the following command::

    python setup.py install

If you cannot build the C extension, you may install just the pure Python
implementation, using the following command::

    python setup.py build_py install --skip-build


------------
Unit Testing
------------

Unit testing is in the :mod:`test` sub-module, e.g. :mod:`cobs.cobs.test`.
To run it on Python >=2.5::

    python -m cobs.cobs.test
    python -m cobs.cobsr.test

Alternatively, in the :file:`test` directory run::

    python test_cobs.py
    python test_cobsr.py

---------------------
Other Implementations
---------------------

The author has also developed pure C implementation [Cimpl]_ of both COBS and
COBS/R, developed in close conjunction with this Python module. The C
implementation is very similar to this Python module's C extension
implementation.
